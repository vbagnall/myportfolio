	<h1 class="prone">Project One &#8211; Object Orientatd Design</h1>
	<img class="proneimg" src="images/proneimg.jpg">
	<p class="pronetxt">In our fist project, we were tasked with learning the ins and outs of Game Maker. The Core Unit for this project was Unit 71, which revolved around Object Orientated Design for Computer Games.</p>
	<p class="pronetxt">We had to research in order to understand the main principles and concepts of Object Orientated Design and apply the techniques that we learned through our research into our games design.</p>
	<p class="pronetxt">In addition to this, we had to research existing games that use Object Orientated Design and apply these to our research. I'm quite fond of RPG Maker games, such as <a href="http://alicemare.chottu.net/">Alice Mare</a> (English translation available <a href="http://vgperson.com/games/alicemare.htm">here</a>), created using the WOLF RPG Editor and <a href="http://kouri.kuchinawa.com/game_01.html">Ib</a> (English available <a href="http://vgperson.com/games/ib.htm">here</a>), created using RPG Maker 2000, which were huge inspirations for me during this project.</p>
	<p class="pronetxt">In the future, I will explore this type of game design in more depth and to expand on the features that I have previously explored within Game Maker.</p>
