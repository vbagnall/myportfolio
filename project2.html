	<p class="protwotxt">In the second project of the year, we looked into spatial storytelling, which is essentially telling a story through environmental factors as opposed to narrative factors. We were tasked with first looking into different games that managed this well, as well as those that didn't manage to achieve it, or maybe those that weren't trying to achieve the effects of spatial storytelling at all.</p>
	<p class="protwotxt">After this, we looked into how 3D Modelling worked, as well as how to <i>make</i> a game in Unreal Engine. In groups, we were tasked with taking over one of the two roles and researching different assets and then putting the research together in order to create a game that tells a story through the environemnt.</p>
