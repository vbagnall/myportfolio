		<p class="aboutxt">Hello! I'm Victoria, and welcome to my portfolio! It seems rather bare at the minute, but hopefully it's going to keep on growing as I do.</p>
		<p class="aboutxt">I've been in a lot of different courses that have led me to Game Design; I tried out A Levels, only to find that they weren't for me. I then gave Childcare a try, which obviously didn't go very well. It was after these years that I applied to do Level 3 TV and Film, and, at the interview, it was suggested that I take Level 2 Creative Media, as I still hadn't found what it was that I wanted to do.</p>
		<p class="aboutxt">Through the year duration of the Level 2 course, I found that I wanted to do something in the game design area. I went to see the course leader partway through the year to find out what Level 3 Game Design would entail, and I was really excited!</p>
		<p class="aboutxt">Being most of the way through the first year of this course already, I can say that this was definitely the right decision. I'm already looking at different University courses and thinking about what might be right for me.</p>
